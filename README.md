# Computer Networks and Applications Projects

## Projects Overview

### 1. webserver
**A non-blocking web server capable of processing multiple simultaneous service requests in parallel.**

### 2. routing
**Routing Algorithm**
- Simulates a network of routers implementing a link-state routing protocol, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), based on Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Compares the time complexity of two Dijkstra implementations (O(N^2) vs O(NlogN)).
